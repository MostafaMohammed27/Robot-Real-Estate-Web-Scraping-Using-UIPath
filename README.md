This robot will display an input dialog for the user to enter a city name in the United States. It will then launch an incognito browser and navigate to Zillow ("https://www.zillow.com/"), a property website. The robot will search using the entered city name, select the "For Sale" option, and apply a filter to display only houses for sale. It will then automatically scrape data such as price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, total square footage, and full address, and once the scraping is complete, it will export the data into an Excel file using UIPath.
